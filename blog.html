                <p class="p-4">
                    map() & forEach() each are used to execute same code on every element but map() returns a new array with update elements, forEach() doesn't change the array and returns undefined.<br>
                    filter() & find() check every element of the array if it meets a certain condition than, filter() returns an array of matching elements but find() return only the first element.

                <p class="p-4">
                    Local-storage data can be deleted via JavaScript or manually, Session data will deleted if the browser or tab is closed, Cookies data can be set to expire at a certain time.<br>
                    Local storage is good for storing data that the user will need to access later, Session storage is good for store sensitive data, Cookies are good for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time.

                <p class="p-4">
                    JavaScript executes all it's operations on a single thread called synchronous programming. But with the event loop JavaScript can perform asynchronous programming.<br><br>
                    The call stack is keeping track of all operations in the line to be execute. If function is finished, it is popped from the stack.<br>
                    The event queue send new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.<br>
                    Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts it's own single-threaded operation.

                <p class="p-4">
                    It's a timer function for the quiz. It displays your quiz time. The function has a parameter if it's value is true then the function will stop and clear the timer value.<br>
                    Otherwise, there is a nested function "setInterval()" which will execute every 1sec and keep the timer running.
